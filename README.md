# Simon

## Overview:
This repo is for the software implementation of the classic game of Simon. This software will provide the user with the opportunity to play Simon, and it will keep track of his score. The description of the game and the requirements of this implementation are presented below.


## The Game:
The user will be presented with a screen containing a colored box in each corner. One red, one blue, one green and one yellow. There will be a start button and a score box in the middle. Once the user presses start, one box will flash white. Then, the user will have to click the box that flashed. On each consecutive turn, an additional box will flash white. i.e. On the second turn, one box will flash and then a second box will flash. Then, the user will have to click two boxes in the order that they flashed. The goal of the game is for the user to repeat the longest sequence of flashing buttons.

*The full spec for the game is in the repo*
